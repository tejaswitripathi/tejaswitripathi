### Hi, I'm Tejaswi Tripathi :D

# About Me
I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at UIUC with a passion for building intelligent systems that **reason, adapt, and learn**. My work spans **reinforcement learning, causal inference, and applied machine learning**, often with a focus on **real-world complexity**: imperfect information, dynamic strategies, or messy behavioral data.

### Selected Projects (wow so cool)
- **PERSONAL FAVORITE! AI Bluff Bot**: Trained an RNN-based agent to master the social deduction game *Coup*, outperforming heuristic and Q-learning baselines in multi-agent settings. I *love* this game–it's my favorite card game–so this project was a huge accomplishment for me.
- **Connect 4 RL Bot**: Designed a hybrid symbolic + neural agent to play Connect 4 in partially observable environments with hidden cells—bridging classical search and modern RL.  
- **Screen Time & Park Accessibility**: Used regression and SQL-driven data fusion to explore how urban infrastructure (like parks) may help reduce smartphone usage. I worked on this while I was exploring data science applications within public policy and urban planning, and while we didn't have all the data we needed for a successful experiment, this was still very fulfilling.
- **Bayesian Spread Modeling**: Modeled farm-to-retail price spreads with hierarchical Bayesian techniques and posterior predictive checks.  
- **College Football Win Rates**: Applied Random Forest and AdaBoost to predict NCAA team success, identifying key game stats that correlate with victory.

### Interests (also very cool)
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning  
- Probabilistic modeling & Bayesian methods  
- Causal inference (TMLE, stochastic interventions)  
- Human-in-the-loop systems & decision-making  
- Applied ML for behavioral and spatial data

### Tools I Use
- Python, PyTorch, SQL  
- Scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  
- PyMC, Bambi, Stan (Bayesian modeling)  
- Git, GitHub, AWS, Jupyter
