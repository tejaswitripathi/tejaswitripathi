# Hi, I'm Tejaswi Tripathi :D

### About Me
I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at UIUC with a passion for building intelligent systems that **reason, adapt, and learn**. My work spans **reinforcement learning, causal inference, and applied machine learning**, often with a focus on **real-world complexity**: imperfect information, adversarial environments, dynamic strategies, or messy behavioral data. But more importantly, I just love learning. I'm exploring web development and application development as you're reading this, and I hope to expand my knowledge even more.

### Selected Projects (wow so cool)
- [**PERSONAL FAVORITE! AI Coup Agent**](https://github.com/tejaswitripathi/Coup-Bot): Trained an RNN-based agent to master the social deduction game *Coup*, outperforming heuristic and Q-learning baselines in multi-agent settings. I *love* this game–it's my favorite card game–so this project was a huge accomplishment for me.
- [**Connect 4 RL Agent**](https://github.com/tejaswitripathi/Connect4): Designed a hybrid symbolic + neural agent to play Connect 4 in partially observable environments with hidden cells—bridging classical search and modern RL.  
- [**Screen Time & Park Accessibility**](https://github.com/tejaswitripathi/CS210-Final): Used regression and SQL-driven data fusion to explore how urban infrastructure (like parks) may help reduce smartphone usage. I worked on this while I was exploring data science applications within public policy and urban planning, and while we didn't have all the data we needed for a successful experiment, this was still very fulfilling.
- [**Bayesian Spread Modeling**](https://github.com/tejaswitripathi/BayesianFoodPrices): Modeled farm-to-retail price spreads with hierarchical Bayesian techniques and posterior predictive checks.  
- [**College Football Win Rates**](https://github.com/tejaswitripathi/FootballStats): Applied Random Forest and AdaBoost to predict NCAA team success, identifying key game stats that correlate with victory.

### Ongoing Projects (get hyped!)
- **Coup Online**: Building an API server to host the RNN Coup Agent I made so that humans can play against it! For this I'm learning React, TypeScript, and CSS–stay tuned!
- **Mortgage Web App**: Imagine if you could input your salary, a mortgage rate, and a down payment, and this website would tell you where you can afford to live. You could compare housing affordability across metro areas. Pretty cool, right?
- **AWS**: Sort of an extension of Coup Online, I'm exploring AWS and studying for the Cloud Practitioner certification to build a web app. Exciting!

### Professional & Academic Interests (also very cool)
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning  
- Probabilistic modeling & Bayesian methods  
- Causal inference (TMLE, stochastic interventions)  
- Human-in-the-loop systems & decision-making  
- Applied ML for behavioral and spatial data

### Tools I Use! I love learning new things, so this list will be expanded
- Python, PyTorch, SQL
- ReactTS, CSS
- Scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  
- PyMC, Bambi, Stan (Bayesian modeling)  
- AWS, Git, GitHub, Jupyter

### Things I Like
- **Reading & Writing**: I'm currently working on 2 novels! My favorite books I've read recently are *The Picture of Dorian Gray* by Oscar Wilde and *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir.
- **Photography & Videography**: I've been doing these on the side throughout college. Recently I got a new camera–a Sony a7 IV–and so I've been more active doing videography lately. Follow my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/josephotoast) and subscribe to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hi8396)!
- **Music**: I haven't been super active here, but I enjoy making piano covers of songs from time to time, as well as composing orchestral music. Subscribe to my [music YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@tejaswi123ful)!
